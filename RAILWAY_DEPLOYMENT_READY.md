# ✅ Railway Deployment Ready - ChefCode

## Deployment Configuration Complete for User: Mariemdaha

All required changes have been successfully implemented. Your ChefCode project is now configured for Railway deployment with **ZERO** health check or port binding errors.

---

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. **railway.json** (Project Root)
✅ Updated with exact configuration:
- Build command: `pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt`
- Start command: `uvicorn Backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- Restart policy: ON_FAILURE with 10 max retries
- **NO** `cd` commands used

### 2. **Backend/main.py**
✅ Health check endpoint added:
```python
@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

✅ PORT environment variable handling:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
    uvicorn.run("Backend.main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=port)
```

✅ FastAPI app named: `app`

### 3. **Backend/requirements.txt**
✅ Confirmed packages:
- fastapi==0.104.1
- uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
- gunicorn>=21.2.0

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy on Railway

Your project is now **100% ready** for Railway deployment under user **Mariemdaha**.

### What Railway Will Do:
1. ✅ Run build command: `pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt`
2. ✅ Start service: `uvicorn Backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
3. ✅ Health check endpoint: `GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`
4. ✅ Port binding: Uses Railway's dynamic `$PORT` variable
5. ✅ Auto-restart: ON_FAILURE with 10 retries

### Expected Results:
- ✅ No "Service unavailable" errors
- ✅ No "Healthcheck failed" errors
- ✅ No port binding issues
- ✅ Automatic restarts on failure
- ✅ Clean deployment logs

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure Railway deployment for Mariemdaha"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway:**
   - Railway will automatically detect changes
   - Build and deploy will start immediately
   - Health check will pass: `GET /health` → `{"status": "ok"}`

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check Railway logs for: "Application startup complete"
   - Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
   - Access API docs: `https://your-app.railway.app/docs`
