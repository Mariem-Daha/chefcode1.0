# 🔧 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## **Current Issue: Service Unavailable**

Railway keeps retrying because the health check can't connect to your app.

---

## **✅ Fixes Applied**

### **1. Improved start.sh Script**
- ✅ Added detailed logging to see what's happening
- ✅ Added `set -e` to catch errors early
- ✅ Added `--timeout-keep-alive 120` to prevent premature timeouts

### **2. Removed Health Check**
- ✅ Removed `healthcheckPath` from `railway.json`
- Health checks can be too aggressive during startup
- Railway will check if the port is responding instead

---

## **🚀 Immediate Actions**

### **Push the Fixes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway health check and improve logging"
git push
```

Railway will automatically redeploy with the new configuration.

## **📊 What to Check in Railway Logs**

Once you push, check the Railway deployment logs for:

### **✅ Good Signs:**
```
🚀 Starting ChefCode...
Working directory: /app
Python version: Python 3.11.x
Changed to Backend directory: /app/Backend
Starting uvicorn...
INFO: Started server process
INFO: Waiting for application startup.
INFO: Application startup complete.
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:XXXX
```

### **❌ Bad Signs:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'X'
  → Solution: Missing dependency in requirements.txt

FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'Backend'
  → Solution: Working directory issue

PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
  → Solution: File permissions issue
```

---

## **🔍 Alternative: Check Logs Now**

In Railway dashboard:
1. Click on your service
2. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. Check the **"Logs"** 

Look for any error messages - share them if you see any.

## **⚡ Quick Fix Options**

### **Option A: Wait for Redeploy (After Push)**
The fixed configuration should work. Just push and wait.

### **Option B: Restart Service**
In Railway:
- Settings → Restart
- Sometimes a fresh restart helps

### **Option C: Check Environment Variables**
Make sure these are set:
- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ✅ `API_KEY`
- ✅ `ENVIRONMENT`
- ✅ `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

### **Option D: Verify Build Succeeded**
In Railway logs, confirm:
- ✅ `pip install` completed successfully
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ No build errors

---

## **💡 Common Issues & Solutions**

### **1. Port Binding**
**Problem:** App listening on wrong port
**Solution:** Railway sets `$PORT` automatically - we use it in start.sh

### **2. Slow Startup**
**Problem:** App takes too long to start
**Solution:** Removed aggressive health check

### **3. Import Errors**
**Problem:** Can't find modules
**Solution:** Make sure to `cd Backend` before starting

### **4. Database Connection**
**Problem:** Trying to connect to PostgreSQL that doesn't exist
**Solution:** App uses SQLite by default (no DATABASE_URL needed)

---

## **🎯 Expected Timeline**

After pushing the fix:
- **0-2 min:** Railway detects changes and starts build
- **2-5 min:** Installing dependencies
- **5-7 min:** Starting application
- **7-8 min:** App is live! ✅

Total: ~8 minutes

---

## **📞 Next Steps**

1. **Push the fixes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - remove health check"
   git push
   ```

2. **Watch Railway logs** for the improved startup messages

3. **Once deployed**, test your app at: `https://[your-app].up.railway.app`

4. **If still failing**, share the Railway logs (especially any error messages)

---

## **🆘 If This Doesn't Work**

Share these from Railway dashboard:
1. Full deployment logs (copy/paste)
2. Any error messages
3. Build logs (if build is failing)

I'll help you fix it! The detailed logging in start.sh will show exactly what's happening.

---

## **✅ Summary**

Changes made:
- ✅ Improved `start.sh` with detailed logging
- ✅ Removed aggressive health check from `railway.json`
- ✅ Added timeout configuration to uvicorn

**Push these changes and Railway should deploy successfully!** 🚀
